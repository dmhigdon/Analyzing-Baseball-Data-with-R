# Analyzing-Baseball-Data-with-R
In this repository I work through the book by the same name by authors Max Marchi, Jim Albert, and Benjamin S. Baumer

Throughout the code in this repository I will be working through examples in the book, as well as questions at the end of each chapter. The purposes of this are two-fold. First, to have a project on which to improve my R skills. Secondly, I enjoy watching basebally and enjoy analyzing the large amounts of data produced around the game, so for fun!
